## Introduction

Welcome to the parallax Space Shooter game, developed in C++ using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. 
In this top-down space ship shooter game, player can control a spaceship, engage in battles with enemy ships and asteroids, and strive to survive
### The Player:
- The player will use the keyboard controls (WSAD) for spaceship movement and shoot projectiles using the spacebar. 
- The player is capable of destroying enemy ships and asteroids by shooting them with projectiles or by colliding with them (suicide). 
- Player loses lives upon collision with enemies or getting hit by enemy projectiles.
### Enemy Ships:
- Sequential spawning of alien enemy ships.
- Different types of enemy ships with distinct actions, include those capable of shooting projectiles. 
- The enemy ships do not collide with asteroids.
- Factory for spawning multiple enemy ships during the game.
### Asteroids:
- Different sizes of asteroids floating or flying across the screen, which become dangerous when heading towards you.
- The asteroids are considered to be obstacles that must be avoided or destroyed.
### Game Background:
- Stars, clouds and other objects move across the screen, providing a dynamic background.
### Data-Driven Design:
- The game loads data from JSON files. 
- Each game element (enemy ship, asteroid, player, etc.) has an associated data file. 
- Data-driven design enables easy modification of textures, lives, health, damage, and other attributes without having to recompile the game.
